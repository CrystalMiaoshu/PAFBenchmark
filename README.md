# Benchmark Datasets for Pedestrian Detection, Action Recognition, and Fall Detection
1. We provide raw data (aedat format) together with frames for pedestrian dataset. Binning the neuromorphic sensor’s outputs in 20 ms interval, continuous event streams are converted to sequences of image frames. Thus, we get 6836 png format pictures with bounding box and all of them are free to download.

2. We recorded ten actions in terms of action recognition dataset. Each action is performed by several people and recorded in three different angles. We upload these ten folders with raw data separately.

3. Fall detection dataset includes fall as positive samples，picking-up, sitting-down and tying the shoelaces as negative samples. We recorded several people performing these actions in three directions as well. Raw aedat data is provided.

## We provide our codes (in Python) respect to three encoding approaches shown in folders.

## How to Handle Datasets

Conventional methods cannot process event data directly. Thus, we employ three encoding approaches here as Frequency, SAE(Surface of Active Events) and LIF(Leaky60Integrate-and-Fire) to process continuous DVS event stream into a sequence of frame images, in order to fit for conventional deep learning algorithms. We provide our codes (in Python) respect to three encoding approaches shown in folders.
